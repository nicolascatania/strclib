# Strclib 

This library is used to manage strings and **password generation**. Coded in C

## Why C?
Because C is a low-level language, which means you have control over memory management and it is highly efficient. Using pointers makes it easy to handle the functions implemented here.

## Installation
The `.dll` must be on the PATH or project directory so you can use it in other programming languages like Python (using `ctypes`, for example).
